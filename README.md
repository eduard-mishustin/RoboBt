## Features

### Control Mechanisms
1. **Mobile App**: Control the car via a mobile application with on-screen buttons.
2. **Accelerometer Control**: Utilize your phone's accelerometer to steer the car.
3. **Gamepad Control**: Use a gamepad for precise control.
4. **Remote Control**: Operate the car remotely from another device.

### Dual Mode Application
- **Host Mode**: Acts as the main control interface.
- **Remote Mode**: Provides a secondary control interface through web sockets, communicating with a Kotlin backend for seamless interaction.

### Video Streaming
- View real-time video from the car's ESP32-based camera module.

### Environmental Monitoring
- Read and display temperature and humidity data from a weather sensor mounted on the car.
